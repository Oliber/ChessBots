# ChessBots

This project implements bots that play against each other in a game of chess

Implemented bot strategies:
  Minimax - Chooses the best move as a result of the opponent's best move
  Alpha-beta - Same behavior as Minimax but reduces the number of calculations
  Both implemented in sequential and parallel algorithms
